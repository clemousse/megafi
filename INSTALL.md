     for more details.

*    Qt framework, version 5. Download it from
     (Qt Downloads)[http://www.qt.io/download/] or from your
     distribution package manager. Qt uses a dual licensing. You
     should get free access for a home usage.

*    libQGLViewer version 2.6. Download and rebuild it following the
     instructions on their
     (website)[http://libqglviewer.com/download.html]. It uses the
     same dual licensing as Qt.
